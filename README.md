# Interpretable Electricity Theft Detection (7-Day)  
**Models:** LSTM | Transformer Attention | Grad-CAM  

This repo implements theft detection on **7-day consumption windows** using deep learning models with interpretability.  
Built from our full notebook (`notebooks/theft_detection.ipynb`) and restructured for reproducibility.
